        description={`During my time as a Growth Engineering Intern, I worked across engineering, product design, and operations to build tools and systems that helped the company scale faster and operate more efficiently. I owned several end-to-end projects (from data collection pipelines and internal automation tools to branding and event planning) each contributing directly to the company's growth roadmap.

On the engineering side, I built a multi-threaded Python web scraper using Playwright to collect event data from Eventbrite, LinkedIn, and Lumaâ€”integrating thousands of data points into the company's event discovery system. I also created an automated email distribution system integrated with Supabase and Google Sheets, streamlining outreach for the operations team and saving hours of manual work each week. Additionally, I developed a Chrome extension to help the sales team track user engagement metrics in real-time, giving leadership better insight into customer behavior.

On the design side, I created the logo for The Venue Collective, a new brand launched by the company for corporate event organizers. I also designed a pool floatie concept in Figma as part of experimental branded merchandise, contributing from early sketches to final mockups. In addition, I designed internal and external assets--including decks, graphics, and presentation templates--that were used across marketing and leadership initiatives.

In addition to technical and design work, I planned a 30-person corporate offsite with a $150K budget, managing logistics, vendor coordination, and on-site execution from start to finish.

This internship taught me how to build quickly, prioritize user needs, and work cross-functionally in a fast-paced environment.`}
